When you click on an answer, it will be highlighted navy blue indicating you've selected it.

For the questions that you type in your own answer, make sure you click the submit button under the user input box. It will clear the text field but don't worry, your answer will be saved.

Upon completion of the questions, click the submit your answers button to be redirected to a page where you can put in your initials and save your high score.
